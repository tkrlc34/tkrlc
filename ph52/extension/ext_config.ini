to know where to put more/less puddles,
 and the new tire physics are interacting negatively 
when the puddle just stops instantly at the edge like that, 
having something to do with the relief though.... 
if you don't define the RELIEF_MATERIALS 
it's just going to use whatever materials/meshes you're using for the puddle map.
" So it would be the curbing that's next to the track, for example.
